### **PRELIMINARY ROUND**

### Preliminary Round 
 
There were 15 Aptitude questions,5 Comprehension, 12 technical questions and 45 minutes were allotted for this.

2 coding questions were also there and 30 minutes were alloted to complete question 1 and 15 minutes for question 2.

**Q1.** A company has n officies in n cities. Each office has 3 teams consisting of different number of members. The company decided to give party to one of the offices. On contacting the hotel, the company came to know about a scheme: hotel offers a discount on the minimum number of members in the team, i.e., if an office has team A with 9 members, team B with 8 members and team C with 5 members, 5 members of team A, 5 members of team B and 5 members of team C will be provided discount. The company will have to pay full for 4 members of team A, 3 members of team B and 0 members of team C.
The company wants to avail the maximum discount while reducing its cost.

The **approach** was to avail the maximum discount by selecting the office with min difference amongst member of its team, and if the sum of difference was same in 2 offices, the offices with more number of members was chosen

This was purely project based.
